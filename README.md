# Employee Analysis

We have worked on a HR Employee Attrition dataset to formulate a model that predicts attrition of the valuable employees in a company.

One can uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.

We will be fit various models on the HR Employee Attrition dataset and check for the most accurate value of attrition.

The best model will then be deployed on a web interface for convinient predictions.
